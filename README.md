# Switch-from-Ecosia-to-Google
A Tampermonkey script (Javascript) to open a Google search in a new window from ecosia.org with the same search parameters. Built for and tested on Chrome on Mac.

Use case:

If you are already using ecosia.org, this script can make it easier to switch to a Google search when you are not satisfied with Ecosia's results.

How to use it?
1. Install Tampermonkey https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=de
2. Add a new user script
3. Add the raw code of this script and hit "save"
4. A button will appear in the top right corner when you are on the result page of an ecosia.org search
5. Click the button to open a new tab in Chrome with the same search query you had chosen for Ecosia - only on Google
6. Feedback welcome
